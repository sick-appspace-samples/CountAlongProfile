## CountAlongProfile
Extracting a profile from an image to be able to count and verify the correct number of items (tea bags.
### Description
This Sample shows how to use the algorithms of the Profile API to count and verify the number of tea bags in a box.

### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main' function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event. Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the profiles after loading the web-page.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.11 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
on AppStudio 3.1.1 or higher can be used.
